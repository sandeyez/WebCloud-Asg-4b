# EXPERIENCE
We struggled a lot in the beginning to get a basic, working pipeline in BRANE. The framework looks promising, but the documentation was limited
in some cases, which made working with BRANE a lot more difficult. We also struggled with the VM that was given to us, since
it was slow and didn't have a lot of memory. We had to empty the memory of the VM twice so we could push new packages to the
VM, otherwise we would get an error at the end of pushing the packages.
